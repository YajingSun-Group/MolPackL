# MolPackL

![demo](/demo.jpg "Scheme")

We constructed an innovative algorithm framework, Molecular Packing Learning (MolPackL), which can accurately quantify elusive IMIs using contact density histograms (CDHs) and efficiently extract intermolecular features for further properties pre-diction of organic solids. It performs satisficing results in training predictive models of six IMIs-related properties in molecular crystals.
